# A BIOMETRICS ATTENDANCE REGISTER PPROTOTYPE

## Introduction

This repository contains all the code and documentation for a project on implementing an attendance register system by employing the use of biometrics.

## Problem statement
In view of the manual attendance register system, it was found to be cumbersome, inefficient and inaccurate to mark attendace using sheets that are called out in class, accumulated throught a study duration and individually analysed to determine a students' attendance and thus merit to examination or certification at the end of a module.

>## Solution

With the advent of tech and it's encouraged inception, it is found valid to not only embrace it in solving such day to day problems as above, but to also do so in a revolutionary and inventive manner. In this light thus, biometrics as a default unique feature in humans was decided as a nethod that would not only come through to fill the gap, but also do so in a secure, robust and timely manner. This thus provides the design and implementation of a biometrics system that will be used in place of the papers used before.
